Collectd Extras & Helper Scripts
======

Over at [Wormly Metrics](https://www.wormly.com/help/metrics-collectd/metrics-overview) we use [collectd](https://collectd.org/) as the basis for collection of system metrics. This lets everyone take advantage of the extensive ecosystem of plugins that have been developed over collectd's 9+ year lifespan and lets us provide you with snazzy graphs like these:

Whilst [our default collectd packages](https://www.wormly.com/help/metrics-collectd/how) are configured to monitor many critical system metrics out of the box, there are a spectacular number of less commonly deployed applications which can easily be monitored with a few extra lines of configuration and / or some simple scripting.

Accordingly, this is our repository of "extras" to make it easier for anyone (be they our customers or otherwise!) to inject some more useful metrics into their monitoring data.
